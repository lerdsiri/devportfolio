                        I have been a mergers & acquisitions lawyer for over 10 years. I am licensed to practice law in California and Thailand.  After relocating to Germany in 2021 due to family-related reasons, I decided that it was time to switch career.  Having studied Industrial and Systems Engineering before I went to law school, I have some background knowledge in programming and statistics.  So switching into data science seems like a natural progression for my career.  To prepare for this career change, I enrolled in a 5-month intensive machine learning program with Integrify, learning all the necessary, practical skills that I need to become an effective data scientist.  As I am familiar with accounting and financial concepts from years of practicing law in the field of mergers & acquisitions, I hope to start my career as a data scientist in FinTech.
